# GHSA-58pv-8j8x-9vj2
# Package: jaraco.context (vendored in setuptools)
# Issue: Path traversal vulnerability in tar extraction
# Reason: This is a vendored dependency inside setuptools that cannot be 
#         directly upgraded via pip. Setuptools maintainers need to update 
#         their vendored version. Dependabot will alert us when setuptools 
#         releases a fix.
# Status: Waiting for setuptools update
# Remove this line once setuptools is patched
